# Praxisprojekt

## List of all scripts and purpose:

test_bagofwords_imdb.ipynb  ->  First implementation of user based embeddings with BagofWords + Test different function computation time

tfidf_recommender_test.ipynb  ->  First implementation of calculation recommendations with Tfidf + Test percentage of regaining used embedding for claculation user embeddings

feature_size_tfidf.ipynb  ->  Test of feature size and the usefulness of working with njit

movie_archive_notebook.ipynb  ->  Basic dataset information + parsing of gernres

doc2vec.ipynb  ->  First doc2vec implementation

doc2vec_test_v2  ->  Second/ Better doc2vc implementation + First Test of fine tuning model

test_script_doc2vec.py  ->  Doc2Vec test script (based on doc2vec_test_v2.ipynb) to run and save different model fine tuning options

bert_test.ipynb  -> First implmentation of Bert(SBert)

https://www.kaggle.com/timpaxi/bert-embedding  -> SBert and Calculation implemented for the GPU + Tests (differnet Versions) of differnet models
